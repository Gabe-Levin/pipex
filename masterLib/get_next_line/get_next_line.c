/*
This one is initializing the static char *stash, in order to have access to
this pointer across multiple function calls. We are checking if the file
descriptior (FD) and BUFFER_SIZE are valid, or if the file is corrupted.
If all looks kosher, we start reading the file into buffer and begin
looking for new lines.

BONUS: This approach initializes stash as an array of char
pointers of length 1024 (an arbitrarily high number for fd). This allows
the function to handle multiple fd's at once. The pointer to the stash
corresponding to a given fd, is stored in the 'fd' index of stash.
Given an fd, the stash[fd] is passed to read_file.

A more storage efficient approach, would be to use a linked list.
This would allow us to store only the minimum required amount of
space for handling multiple fds, as appose to immediately initalizing
a large array of pointers.
